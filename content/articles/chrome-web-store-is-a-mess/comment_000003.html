<p>I'm agree, and I'm especially against an ID measure, it'd solely work against good faith devs. It'd also be hypocritical of me, as when I started, it certainly would have excluded myself. 
That being said, however, raising the fee would certainly increase the barrier to entry tangibly. Whilst large malicious entities would have no issue, there is little that can do so regardless. It would counteract a lot of spam though, at least imo. </p>
<p>I think many measures are nneeded at this point, this being one tool that CWS can weild.
And CWS currently needs any tool it can get. It could even be temporary. 
As a matter of fact, perhaps only after surpassing a certain threshold, additional measures come in to play. 
That way hobbyists can get a taste before investing more resources. </p>
<p>To be completely honest, what Google needs the most is to have an open discussion in which they themselves participate in. (That is if they actually strive for the best and act in good faith)
The likes of Oliver and Patrick are friendly, but in my eyes act more as mediators, than representatives of our side. I can only hope that with fresher faces, come fresh perspectives and a willingness to co-operate.</p>

<p>Don’t ask me, ask them. At the very least they still have that counter of “planted” trees on their website. And from the look of it their counter still follows the same linear trajectory. Eden Plus website still lists them in the same “$50,000 - $99,999” category, so it still looks like they did a one-time donation in 2023 and never again. This money is nowhere near enough to buy 800k trees.</p>
<p>Not that add-on stores really concern themselves with such things. They don’t consider it their job to verify whether the claims made by extensions are true or even remotely realistic.</p>

<p>The only disagreement this longtime Chrome dev has is with your statement that Google employees will disagree. I think all of us recognize the problems with no headcount for manual enforcement of anything, and over reliance on automated systems. But it's not a problem we're able to address. Unless web store quality hurts Chrome market share, it's hard for me to see top-level management investing huge sums in improving it.</p>
<p>I have internally passed along several of your past reports, and get a bit deeper look into the responses. I have takes. But sharing them is, unfortunately, probably not appropriate. I will only say that I am unsatisfied with our response framework.</p>
<p>I suspect if Google really wants to get serious here, it will need to accept increased risk of lawsuits from extension developers acting in bad faith. It looks to me as if Google is very conservative on that front, because developers can and do sue, while users generally don't, and Google is legally risk-averse.</p>

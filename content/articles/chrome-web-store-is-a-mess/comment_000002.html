<p>Insightful read!</p>
<p>I do want to point out that you may be underestimating Edge's marketshare - having worked for two govt agencies: one, in the process of moving to Edge (and even disallowing Chrome), and the other having intentions on doing so. So you may find many enterprises, especially those invested in M365 to be using the Edge store over CWS. Though: 1. Possible a moot point considering CWS Exts work on edge, and 2. this is purely anecdotal, so I don't know how well it translates reality.</p>
<p>RE: 'What could Google do?' and the 60% figure - 
In a bitter(for many)-sweet upside, the MV3 enforcement will surely help with this. Perhaps Google's counting on that before they do anything else. <em>That</em> wouldn't be illogical reasoning at least. (I mean what's <em>another</em> 6 months of this? Right?)</p>
<p>But I'm in alignment with the article, like the one prior, it's a depressing read. 
I'm also now more sympathetic to some suggestions raised in a back-linked <a href="https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/g/chromium-extensions/c/tSxUn2qk9ls" rel="nofollow">g-groups thread</a> (thanks Juraj), though I'd hate to see the rent-seeking policies Apple has, being adopted. Though the established $5 et al, evidently doesn't work either. </p>
<p>Certainly a thorny situation.

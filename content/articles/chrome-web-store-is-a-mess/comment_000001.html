<p>Interesting conspiracy in the last sentence! :)
And it may as well be true. Since apart from bad PR, there is no big business downside for this state.
It's only a "morally correct thing to do", but that won't pay for the bills.</p>
<p>Let's be honest here, why are there no extensions in the Chrome for Android?
Or even easier question - why were the adblocks removed from the Play Store?
And that's no "conspiracy theory", it's a logical thing to do for a company that sells ads.
So under-funding desktop extensions team looks totally OK now... but it's sad :(</p>

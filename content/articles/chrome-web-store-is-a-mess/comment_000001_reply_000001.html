<p>Google did experiment with extensions on Android, this being an extremely popular feature request. Official explanation why they never enabled them: extensions were too detrimental for performance. There is of course also an unofficial explanation: there is no real pressure on Google to implement this, Chrome having essentially no competition on Android.</p>
<p>Firefox finally allowed arbitrary extensions on mobile (I’m glad to have been wrong about that). Still, it doesn’t look like this is enough incentive for people to switch mobile browsers.</p>
<p>Oh, and ad blockers were removed from Play Store because they were “interfering with other applications.” :-) In other words: Google had to tolerate ad blockers in Chrome because they entered an established market here, and not having ad blockers would be detrimental to their market share. They didn’t have that issue with Android.</p>

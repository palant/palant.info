<p>I am definitely not in favor of raising the developer fee or requiring a prove of identity. The former wouldn’t be a serious hurdle to companies like BroCode or ZingFront, and there are plenty of shady companies operating under their real name (see Colibri Hero and Karma examples in this post). Yet both measures would raise the bar for hobby programmers considerably and exclude most of them. A Chrome Web Store full of corporate spam isn’t the right direction IMHO.</p>

<p>I fully agree with the author.</p>
<p>I have personally submitted multiple reports to Google regarding deceptive and hijacker-style Chrome extensions, and the experience is extremely frustrating. Malware, PUPs, and browser hijackers often remain in the Chrome Web Store for years without meaningful action.</p>
<p>A concrete example is extension ID fbkojfmgglelmhepbajcpkonjabpobbc, as well as codnabjahlcbleacelaabcphcobjkmlf. These extensions are distributed through forced installation flows: users are redirected from third-party websites and are blocked from accessing promised functionality unless they install the extension.</p>
<p>After installation, these extensions modify browser settings by replacing Google Search with a fake search engine and hijacking user queries. When users type brand names such as AliExpress, the extension does not show a real search results page at all — it immediately redirects the user to the brand website with an affiliate ID attached, silently monetizing the traffic.</p>
<p>This is classic browser hijacking and affiliate fraud behavior, yet these extensions remain available in the Chrome Web Store. Meanwhile, Google continues to display reassuring statements like “this developer declares that your data is not sold to third parties,” even when the actual behavior clearly contradicts user expectations.</p>
<p>I strongly agree with the conclusion that Chrome Web Store moderation is fundamentally broken. Reporting abusive extensions often feels pointless, as clearly malicious or deceptive items are tolerated for years while users remain unprotected.</p>

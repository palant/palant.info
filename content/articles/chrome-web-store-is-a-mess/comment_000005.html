<p>If someone copies this the link back to this page is https://palant.info/2025/01/13/chrome-web-store-is-a-mess/ </p>
<p>First, if anyone reads this, know and understand that Vladimir is a tireless and dedicated professional genius who 100% understands the dangers of the Chrome Web Store.  I am a bonafide DFIR engineer and malware hunter and my credentials are below.  This is not a self-promotion.  I am a senior citizen and exhausted from the tireless work of the only way to stop the bad guys: teach people, one person at a time, to “run to the hills” away from (most) extensions.  I have taught over 1,100 people over the last 12 years.</p>
<p>No matter what Google tells you about their efforts to build in security or redesign how extensions must be architected and whatever guardrails they put in, the old adage applies: “the bad guys will always be a step or two ahead of the good guys”.  I could make a very strong case for this but I could not evangelize and run the experiments that Vladmir does. However, he does precisely what I would do, given enough time.  So kudos and gratitude to Vladmir.</p>
<p>Every warning Vladmir gives I have been giving people for years.  Vladmir, as former developer of Adblock, establishes my credibility but my clients already trust my judgement.</p>
<p>I <em>have</em> written simple PowerShell scripts that set the policy in the registery to never allow <em>any</em> extension to be added to Chrome, Edge or Firefox and a few customers gladly take this code.  It’s doing well.  If it was extremely widespread bad guys would code around it.  That’s the beauty of teaching people one at a time, quietly.  Each one is one less target the perps can go after.  Making small chinks in the evil criminals armor is better than doing nothing.</p>
<p>I teach extreme vetting and done quickly.  There are many red flags to look for and if any, even one, arise, “run to the hills” and give it up.  A Fortune 1000 company who writes an extension will not have even one red flag.  Anyone else’s extension has a higher chance of being infiltrated, lurking for years and then slipping a pushed update that Chrome misses (and what Vladmir has proven by watching those 1600 extensions daily until bam! one leaps at you and does it’s dirty deeds YEARS LATER.  I call that “lurking”. 
I also use use static analysis tools by AnyRun and Hybrid Analysis.  I cannot afford these $5K annual subscription and the free version is limited.  But if it doesn’t kill you to use these tools, it will make you stronger.  They run it in a sandbox for 60 seconds which is a long way off waiting 5 years for a new version to rear it’s ugly head.  And each older version may morph itself in ways that no one has the time to study the JavaScript code to understand what it does.  </p>
<p>But Anyrun and Hybrid will at least tell you if it sees any of the patterns from MITRE ATT&amp;CK (see https://d3fend.mitre.org/ ).  Some extensions have 100s of files and that exceeds what can be uploaded (even in a single zip file) but you can turn the entire set of code into a single runnable hta or .js file. Not exactly the same as running under the Google extension model but adequate for static MITRE analysis and a 60-second run.  </p>
<p>For example, I recently checked out a C<strong><em>*</em></strong>*r extension (name omitted but will disclose if you PM me).  This code should have been doable in a few hundred lines of .js.  But it was 11,000 lines.  My powershell script produced two lines of non-obfuscated code (whew!) and a web site java script beautifier turned it into those 11,00 lines.  It had many MITRE ATT&amp;CK patterns in it.  Hybrid said it was SUSPICIOUS at a score of 30/100.  </p>
<p>I don’t have the time to ramp up on studying this code (I was an expert C++ and C# programmer for many years). But 11,000 lines and all those MITRE issues is a red flag to ….. “run to the hills”. I am not interested in why there may be a good reason for there to be 11,000 lines of code but I simply will not take the risk nor should you. There was only a simple web site for the tool and it had all my vetting red flags (not address, no phone, not “About Us”, no nothing).  Except for the author (gmail) email to contact -- I researched that email and found nothing.  I asked him/her a simple question about his/her country of origin and as you might expect, no answer (red flag #2) as come in.  Final VERDICT: guilty. <br>
I have thought long and hard, as have some of you and Vladmir, why Google seemingly doesn’t care.  The answer is my own opinion: they put some extensions out there of their own to spy on criminals and terrorists and they want not-so-smart criminals to risk using these tools so that they can be caught.  There are 100s of things the intelligence agencies will do to get intelligence and Google and Microsoft are going to cooperate in the interest of national security.  </p>
<p>That makes ordinary people who add extensions and trust Google, <strong><em>intentional collateral damage</em></strong>.  </p>
<p>But not my customers. :-) They have been taught to say “no” to every prompt and block all notifications in the browser.  But it’s not easy, without even more work to do, to stop push technology updates both from the Edge/Chrome web stores or the Microsoft Store.  There should be an option to prompt to update:</p>
<pre><code>Extension Track-Package-and-give-you-weather :-) wants to update.  Select 1 to 3
1. update now
2. do not update right now, check another time
3. review changes made for this version (developer must provide at least 100 words?)|
4. skip this update all together and return to browser
</code></pre>
<p>I would teach my clients if it is a not-so-well-known extension, select option 4.</p>
<p>Another suggestion would be for Google to upload to Hybrid Analysis and only permit it if the score is below a certain threshold.  Google already has something like this behind the scenes as a super-powerful web app that does 1000x more than VirusTotal.  Very cool!  But it is ONLY SOLD TO corporations who should (and smart ones do) studying everything.  </p>
<p>But small fry consultants like Vladmir or I even begging to able to upload perhaps one file a week is met with a NO. That is saying “we don’t care about how smart you are – don’t mess with our intelligence efforts – we only cater to corporations”.</p>
<p>That just further cements how important it is for Google to get malware in the form of extensions into the everyday non-corporate household.  It breaks my heart.  Laugh all you want, but there is a long history of the NSA/CIA working this way and an elite Google team can tell you all about it but never will!  I draw these conclusions from abductive logic, the hallmark of a very smart person like Vladmir or myself, to understand the criminal mind and spy vs. spy.  (Other examples: which VPN companies does CIA own – at least one in the past?  Which node(s) do they run in the TOR network to get even scant and incomplete information?  Why did Dropbox CEO state fact check that noone in the planet can see any of your cloud files stored on their servers and then admit they lied about it and would show files to certain subpoenas?  Etc., etc.</p>
<p>Finally, I have now run into a new sad issue which is this: Norton 360 is very popular and is sold with popular Norton LifeLock.  Gen Digital purchased Norton who purchased Avast some time ago and incorporated it into their product and it installs a Norton Secure browser which is really the AVG Secure browser which is really a Chromium based browser that Avast promoted when they purchased AVG.  There are many reasons not to use this browser but all of my customers with Norton who rely on Chrome find the icon for the Secure Browser similar to Google Chrome.  But the location of extensions is completely different from the well know Edge, Chrome, and Firefox add-ons locations.  In fact, depending on whether the customer started/has the AVG, Avast or Norton version determines the path.  And all those wonderful tools like Nirsofer’s browseraddsonsview now have to be called from the command line to check those locations and to do so is not documented clearly by Nirsofer but it <em>can</em> be figured out.  Shame on Norton.  They could atone by making a free tool similar to  browseraddsonsview that dumps the addons to a CSV.</p>
<p>Don’t hold your breath.</p>
<p>Thanks and if anyone wants to volunteer to study C<strong><em>*</em></strong>*r PM me at misterharrystein  and the add the @ and gmail  and .com.  Identify yourself with a linkedin when you write.</p>
<p>Blessings,</p>

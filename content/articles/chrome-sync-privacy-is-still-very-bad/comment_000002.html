<p>Got any updates on Firefox Sync given their new crazy ToS? I am moving elsewhere but I always liked Firefox Sync (not using it for passwords, but sending tabs to devices an having history synced is awesome) and I'd like to have a similar service.. Floorp supports it, so I am considering going there.</p>
<p>Had a look at the bug report and it seems they recently resolved it - could you please give your expert opinion? https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1320222</p>

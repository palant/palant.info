<p>Thanks, I see where I went wrong.  Thanks for the privacy concern and no worries as this camera is offline and will be forever so no issues there.  I am glad you are informing people about the high risk of these cameras when they are kept "online".   I only kept this last one online as a tester and of course monitored everything that came in and out, again for testing and forensic purposes.  These PPPP cameras I have are nifty with the dual lens, 1 wide and 1 telephoto.  I like these a little better than the Wyze cams because of this, although I am still fully vested on Wyze as well.  Wyze cameras are/were also fun to deep dive into and I also created my own infrastructure for them as well although not quite to the protocol level like these cams because Wyze uses TUTK which is a commercial package.  So I use the TUTK library for protocol level control.  Thanks to you I can now feed my PPPP cameras my own  "EESJSJDLKJDLS...:vstarcam..." IPs to my own LAN p2p server and they can stay offline and happy and stop clogging my network with the 32100 blasts.  Love your articles and picked up on some things I was not aware of as I continue my "secure" journey.</p>

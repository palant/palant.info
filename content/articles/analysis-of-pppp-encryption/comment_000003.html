<p>Your slight implementaion difference is correct if you are seeing VSTJ, my script is returning the following with an empty key:</p>
<p>561fa08ac80a00fe1aa288ab1846f0ba5056d29e0cdbbc3048ac8d0cedd1ac495d428a969ccee28a</p>
<p>The CRCTable I am using is:  CRCTABLE = [ 0x95 ... 0x29 ]</p>
<p>If that's the same as what you are using, can you help me with what I am missing?   It doesn't have to be python.</p>

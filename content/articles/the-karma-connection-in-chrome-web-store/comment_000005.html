<p>IMHO you should assume that the browser you were using all this time is basically toasted. If I were you I would not only remove cookies but I would change passwords to all sites I visit and do a browser reset, making sure that it gets new fingerprinting IDs. One might tell that it's overkill, but I'm not taking any chances.</p>

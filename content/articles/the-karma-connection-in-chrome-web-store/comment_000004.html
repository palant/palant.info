<p>Found my way to this blog post after DarkPDF, which I had installed, was flagged as malicious. It is bewildering to me that Google does not maintain a list of all of the extensions that have been flagged as malicious and what they have compromised. I was left completely in the dark and wondering if my passwords and banking info had been compromised until I found a link to this blog on a forum post.</p>
<p>If you, like me, were a victim of this attack, what actions should you take? Should I clear my cookies so whatever tracking cookie they pulled down is wiped? If so, is there a way to just surgically remove that one cookie, or do I need to clear them all?</p>

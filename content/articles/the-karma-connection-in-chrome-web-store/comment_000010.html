<p>Hello,</p>
<p>Thanks for the great research. I have a couple of questions:
1) Regarding the "Browsing profile collection," was the full URL (with path and parameters) sent to the Amazon endpoint, or only the domain?
2) Is the profile collection done for all pages opened by the user at any moment, or only when specific conditions are met, such as the domain being one of the 6,553 hosts on the list?
3) Is there a way to retrieve the list of these 6,553 host names? Running curl on the previous links returns a simple {"selectors":[]}. Maybe some parameter or specific agent is needed.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance</p>

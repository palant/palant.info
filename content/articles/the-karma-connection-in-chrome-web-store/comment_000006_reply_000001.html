<p>Unfortunately, there isn’t much I can help you with. I don’t think Chrome keeps any usage timestamps around for extensions. And I don’t think you can do much about data once it’s gone – you can only think what it would mean if e.g. your government got hold of this data and, if this is in fact part of your threat model, consider the possible precautions.</p>

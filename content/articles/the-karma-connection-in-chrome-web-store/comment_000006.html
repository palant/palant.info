<p>2 questions</p>
<p>Is there a way to check when the extension was last used on Chrome. I had the extension downloaded, but don't know if it was actively being used/turned on.</p>
<p>Is there anything users should do? Change passwords etc. or just hope nothing bad happens with the browsing data.</p>
<p>Thank you for looking into this.</p>

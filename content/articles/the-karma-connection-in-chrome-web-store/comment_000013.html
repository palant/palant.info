<p>Thank you for your research into this topic. I’ve been using Hide YouTube Shorts for a while, and recently found out about these extensions now I’m really concerned about my personal data, especially my passwords, being stolen. You mentioned that this extension was tracking my browsing and sending data to external servers. My question is did it send any of my of usernames or passwords while I was using it as well or was it only my browsing data. Are any of the accounts I have accessed while using the extension compromised? Thank you again for bring this issue to light with your research.</p>

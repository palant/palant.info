<p>Hi Palant,</p>
<p>Thanks for the response. I have one more question what was running in my mind and really curious to know,  how daily or monthly the manifests-dataset is updating and what tools you use to scrap chrome extensions regularly and put it in one place.</p>
<p>I am very much interested to perform analysis like you, so please tell me what tools and the process of scrapping the chrome extensions from webstore and also how to query them after getting them into one sheet.</p>
<p>awaiting for your reply </p>
<p>Thanks in advance</p>

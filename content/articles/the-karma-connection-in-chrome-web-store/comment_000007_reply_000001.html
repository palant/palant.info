<p>I am scraping Chrome extension manifests regularly, see <a href="https://github.com/palant/chrome-extension-manifests-dataset" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/palant/chrome-extension-manifests-dataset</a>. This repository contains tools to list manifests matching specific criteria. I also have the more popular extensions downloaded and indexed in a database. Thatâ€™s it.</p>

<p>Password strength for normal users</p>
<p>Besides the text-based https://lowe.github.io/tryzxcvbn/ there is another page, which has zxcvbn, Stutz, and 3 more typical password meters implemented: https://www.cryptool.org/en/cto/password-meter</p>
<p>CTO's password meter also runs purely locally in the browser.</p>
<p>For zxcvbn and Stutz the details (like in https://lowe.github.io/tryzxcvbn/) can be unfold; all five password-meter algorithms are visually compared by indicators. So this is helpful for normal users and incorporates different password meters.</p>
<p>CTO's password meter is the result of a bachelor thesis. It is open-source and free, and it is used as awareness tool in some companies to give employees hints before they select their password.</p>

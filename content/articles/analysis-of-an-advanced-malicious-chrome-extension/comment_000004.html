<p>hello Palant, another impressive read! </p>
<p>thank you for your efforts to share your knowledge!</p>
<p>Could you share which version of "Download Manager Integration Checklist" you used for this writeup?</p>
<p>I'm interested in the part where it updates dynamically the declarativeNetRequest with "chrome.declarativeNetRequest.updateDynamicRules" but I couldn't find it in current version 4.3.0.</p>

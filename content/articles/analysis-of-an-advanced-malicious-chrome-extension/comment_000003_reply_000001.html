<p>This is bad code but it is not a security issue:</p>
<ol>
<li>The only caller of this function calls it on data loaded from extension storage. I cannot see how malicious code would get into storage.</li>
<li>That caller appears to be dead code, I cannot see anything calling it.</li>
<li>Most importantly, any execution of dynamic code will be prevented by Content Security Policy in this context. <code>eval()</code> and the like are generally forbidden in Manifest V3 extensions (in Manifest V2 they were forbidden by default but this restriction could be relaxed).</li>
</ol>

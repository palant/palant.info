<p>Yes, there are a few legitimate use cases for messing with CSP, but never on a global scale. And just nuking the entire policy is always bad. But I’m afraid that there are really clueless developers out there messing with CSP when it is avoidable, not only malicious extensions. Still, building a website to detect this manipulation would be in fact possible – sounds like a good idea.</p>

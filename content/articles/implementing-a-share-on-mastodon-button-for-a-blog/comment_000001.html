<p>In case you are interested in Lemmy, clicking on the share with Fediverse button did not work with lemmy.world.  Lemmy.world expects https://lemmy.world/create_post and entering simply "lemmy.world" in the link field attempted to post to /share?.... which led nowhere.  I also tried entering the entire link.</p>

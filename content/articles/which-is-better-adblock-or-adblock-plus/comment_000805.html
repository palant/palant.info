<ul>
<li>Adblock Plus has its own telemetry now (found through its GitLab repository - good job for keeping that at least)</li>
<li>eyeo, the company you created to maintain Adblock Plus, bought BetaFish, the company created to maintain AdBlock</li>
<li>Both blockers are now basically the same</li>
</ul>
<p>Oh yeah, and on the topic of blockers, Adblock Plus is completely inferior to uBO, with uBOsupporting more features and being more lightweight all-around, and with MV3 Adblock Plus' service worker approach is now inferior to uBOL's declarative approach, as uBOL can start filtering instantly at browser launch, is more lightweight than Adblock Plus, and does not lose its filtering capability temporarily every 30 seconds (unlike Adblock Plus)</p>

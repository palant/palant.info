<p>Thanks for writing this article. I have been using the refoorest extension for years at work, but it would always bug out at 300 trees. I started getting suspicious, so I tried looking online on any clues about it, but nothing was conclusive or sufficient. I eventually stopped using it when I changed browsers, and on my old one today I found out it was detected as malware. Found this article, and it all makes perfect sense when put together, since it was just too easy, too vague.</p>

<p>I think I downloaded this extension about a month before this was published. I remember being skeptical about it but the reviews on the chrome web store seemed good so I got it. Man I wish I had seen this blog earlier. Fun fact, I checked their website today and the testimonies are still there (which btw I work in marketing and that is 100% AI). Same names, different photos.</p>

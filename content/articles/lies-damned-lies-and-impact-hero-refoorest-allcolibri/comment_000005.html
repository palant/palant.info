<p>Even though so many people are using refoorest extension they don't bother to ask questions for their work. Nothing is shown realistically, there is no proof of them actually planting trees anywhere. I mean seriously it's 2025, it won't even take a minute to post a video of them actually planting trees. I always had this doubt that these guys might be shady but couldn't find even a single article against them. I guess I did not search thoroughly because of the noble cause it has. Thanks for making us aware.</p>

<p>Hi, Wladimir, I enjoy reading your blog posts. I wonder if you've ever come across the Abus Smartvest home security range. The smartphone app which connects to the system base station shows a device ID which appears to be similar to those of this PPPP protocol, but with four letters as the device prefix: “ABCD-123456-ABCDE”.</p>

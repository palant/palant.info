<p>Ironically, this specific piece of software "Online Security" by ReasonLabs is malware.</p>
<p>The most classic phishing or ransomware attacks involve malware posing as antivirus, before removing real antivirus and trying to get the user to download more malicious software.</p>
<p>Reasonlabs have constructed something VERY similar.</p>
<p>"Online Security" is bundled with other software. It's at best, bloatware. The same company does the same thing with their RAV software. My work machine is a pretty low vulnerability target. It's entirely got productivity software on it from my work, it's a clean install, and if I have to, I can just wipe it and reinstall. I had an adobe acrobat extension, ublock, and the google workspace extension. Somehow, "Online Security" by ReasonLabs infected my computer. I noticed it sending chrome notifications, and removed it. I was already concerned because I had never added it.</p>
<p>The software, within a few minutes, executed a command line prompt, literally flashed up the command line like it was executing a batch file, and chrome was asking me if I would like to verify this add on.</p>
<p>I had to track it down to the registry and edit my registry to make sure the extension wasn't able to keep doing this.</p>
<p>This is a malicious and unethical way for this software to behave.</p>
<p>Considering the other data breaches and espionage issues from it's country of origin, I would not trust them at all in any way.</p>
<p>Their extension page on the google store is 99% botted comments.</p>
<p>Google needs to remove this software from their store, and add their website to a suspicious website list. At best, this is a scam where they try to get you to buy something you don't need.</p>
<p>At worst, this is a scam where they are stealing your data.</p>

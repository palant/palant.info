<p>This is true, and they try to install the extension forcefully, if it is available on some unsecured website you visit. If you start seeing something like error: new extension "online security" added, in chrome, then they are repeatedly trying to install the extension on all your browser profiles. 
It seems like they have put a key in the registry that keeps doing this, this is disgusting.
I think a solution for this is available here: https://superuser.com/questions/1348212/what-causes-chrome-to-automatically-install-extensions</p>
<p>Here, there are other people who faced the same problem: https://www.reddit.com/r/chrome/comments/14ch67j/online_security_keeps_automatically_installing/</p>
<p>And thank you very much for making aware of this, this was such a great article, everything is perfectly explained. You have my gratitude :)</p>

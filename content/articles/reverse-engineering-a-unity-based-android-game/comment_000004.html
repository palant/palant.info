<p>The process of fully reverse engineering a unity android game sure seems troublesome. I have managed to do it with a simple app, but i am struggling with recompiling it to a working state. That got me curious at which state would it be best to alter the code assuming you know where and what to alter? It would be amazing to see some guides/articles on that.</p>

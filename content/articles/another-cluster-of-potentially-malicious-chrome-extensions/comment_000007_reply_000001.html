<p>Yes, malicious extensions are very prevalent in Chrome Web Store, and Google doesn’t have this issue under control. Search redirection in particular is a very lucrative business. So there are companies which will push out seemingly legit extensions en masse, often with the same functionality. For a number of categories the actually legitimate extensions are completely drowned out.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there is no technical solution to this. Even if injecting code into web pages could be prohibited, a malicious extension could still do considerable damage. So your best chance is not installing malicious extensions in the first place.</p>
<p>And that means that you cannot rely on Chrome Web Store for finding extensions to install. You have to look for extensions that are being developed by a known actor (a real person with a name or a company with known goals), ideally with a track record of beneficial development spanning several years, maybe even open source development where you can see the history. And some tasks just don’t need an extension, even if one would be convenient.</p>

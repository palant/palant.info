<p>I’ve been doing it mostly manually as well. I have my collection of extension manifests (<a href="https://github.com/palant/chrome-extension-manifests-dataset" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/palant/chrome-extension-manifests-dataset</a>), and for this research I also downloaded the more popular extensions and put them into an SQLite database so that I could run full-text searches. But that’s it.</p>

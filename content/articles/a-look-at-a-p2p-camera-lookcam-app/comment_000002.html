<p>Thank you for your amazing and thorough work. 
I think the only solution for such cameras isn’t disposal but rather replacing the firmware on the camera. 
There are many different open source projects devoted to either providing such devices with new firmware or opening them up to allow more control (a crucial addition is introducing Onvif compatibility which allows the camera to leave its communication walled garden and work as a regular IP camera). 
I prefer this solution since it keeps ewaste from being created, despite the fact that the cameras using LookCam are the worst examples of being hardware and software kludged together.</p>

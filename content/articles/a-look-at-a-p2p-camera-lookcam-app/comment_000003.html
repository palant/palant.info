<p>I know firsthand of a situation where a Lookcam app had been installed and connected to a camera. That camera broke and was no longer in service, but it's ID was not removed from the app. A year or so later, the Lookcam app was opened and it automatically connected to somebody else's camera in another part of the world. So the manufacturers apparently reuse the camera IDs.</p>

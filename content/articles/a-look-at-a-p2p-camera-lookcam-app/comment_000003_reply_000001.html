<p>Wow, that is… bad. How did they even know that this ID can be reused? Or do they generally do it when a particular ID isn’t seen on the servers for a while? Quite ridiculous, particularly given that they still have a dozen device prefixes reserved for future use, meaning that they could issue millions of new device IDs even if their current namespaces are exhausted.</p>

<p>I have no idea how they implemented it. If you say that the master password is still mandatory, then adding a passkey doesn’t make things more secure – merely more convenient.</p>
<p>If they left the passkey as the only means of accessing the data, then in principle it would be more secure than a password – simply because passwords rarely have sufficient entropy. On the other hand, one would have to consider the possibility of a passkey being stolen or otherwise accessed due to insufficient physical protection. I cannot yet judge how realistic that scenario is.</p>

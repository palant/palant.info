<p>Appreciate that you highlighted this issue &amp; now BitWarden offers Argon2id.  Good on you for airing the topic! Many of us thank you personally.</p>
<p>I'm interested on your thoughts about their passkey login option.  They allow you to do encryption the vault encryption key based on the passkey.  Do you find this implementation in general more secure than relying on the master password?  I'm aware the master password is still a threat vector, since they don't allow removing the master password.  But if they did, would the passkey implementation be more secure than a strong high entropy master password?</p>

<p>I am an ordinary person.  Yet, I estimate that I probably have nearly 500 web accounts. Crazy - but that includes not only important stuff, like my email accounts, and home utility accounts, but also accounts set up with every vendor I've interacted with, every website that's required me to register before commenting, etc.  Not all of these are active accounts, and many I will never log into again.  But even if only 15 or so accounts are important to me, that would still be a heck of a lot of random passphrases (or fancy passwords) to remember.  My point is that perhaps there needs to be a dichotomy -  a very small set of sites (e.g., maybe only your email, your password manager, and Apple and/or Google) for which you memorize a random passphrase - and a much larger set of less important sites for which you generate long, random passwords or passphrases that you never attempt to remember, but just paste from your password manager.  Maybe write down your small set of important passphrases/passwords, and do not store them in your password manager, or any obvious place online or on your computer. (It sounds great to have a 25-character passphrase/password for your password manager, but I'm not sure how you could securely copy and paste that in when needed to unlock your vault - although I believe some people utilize two password managers.)</p>

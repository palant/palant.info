<p>My current experience as IT Manager for a company dealing with the Korean division of a major global bank is that the "security software" requires admin rights to run each time. So they expect me to introduce a security vulnerability by granting local admin rights to a high-risk finance user.
Does anyone have experience with why this software requests elevation, and any workaround?</p>

<p>As one of the people who'd been using EP/PfP for multiple years: Thank you for this project!</p>
<p>EP was my first password manager, from there I made the switch to PfP. And then I did switch to Bitwarden two years ago, for various reasons.</p>
<p>UX-wise, PfP was quite a bit ahead of Bitwarden in many ways. The whole workflow of "I am creating a new account and I need a password manager entry to be created along with it" is so much easier in PfP. Generating the entry and the password in a single step is pretty much unbeatable. With Bitwarden, I forget clicking the final Save button every so often and lose the in-progress entry.</p>
<p>Then Bitwarden has a whole host of additional complexity ... some of which is appreciated, much of which I barely use. PfP also was a great intro to password managers because so many of its details were so well thought-out, e.g. URL matching. Bitwarden gives the full power of regexes there, but with PfP, I never much needed that. The default settings were so good that most rationally-built websites worked out-of-the-box.</p>
<p>Getting to see the encrypted, synced, JSON file in Dropbox (or with the export feature) was also cool, given how most managers (except Keepass derivatives) hate to give you the passwords file in an easy-to-backup way.</p>
<p>So, a belated thank-you for the project!</p>

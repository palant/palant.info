<p>The recovery aspect, and the aliases, make this very compelling.  I also like the user interface.  Thank you.  May I ask:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Must the host application reside in the <strong>Downloads</strong> directory?</p>
<ul>
<li>(It's possible that extensions can only message host apps in this directory on some operating systems.)
And if it must, can it reside in a subdirectory of Downloads?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>When, if ever, do you think you will support <strong>modification times</strong> for changes to entries?</p>
</li>
</ol>

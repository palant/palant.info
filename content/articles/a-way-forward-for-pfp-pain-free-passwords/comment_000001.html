<p>With 3.1 and above, the context, strongly implied above, is to use a variant of KeePass for iOS and Android; and then use PfP in various desktops.  Synchronization of the keepass kdbx file is to be done externally to PfP.  That sounds good on the surface.  However, in this article you state <strong>"... no more merging of changes."</strong></p>
<p>With that as a background, what happens when the keepass kdbx files have not been synced in a while and would need proper entry-by-entry merging when eventually synced?  Imagine this example: a desktop is running PfP and has update A; an iOS is running keepassXC and has an update B; and an android device is running keepass2android and has an update C.  If the syncing is done by sneakernet and lazily, which is a fallback position at least, how could the keepass databases all end up with the latest entries for A, B, and C?</p>
<p>No matter the sync technology used, syncs don't always happen when they need to IME.</p>

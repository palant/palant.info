<p>Given that Bitdefender was already pretty good last time I checked, I don’t really see the point of revisiting them – I wouldn’t expect them to get much worse. You have to keep in mind: normally when I look at antivirus products, I see tons of attack surface, and I go for the issue that should be easiest to exploit. In Bitdefender’s case on the other hand it was all pretty solid and only one notable issue.</p>
<p>Browsers do allow antivirus products to scan encrypted connections. Back in 2018 the adoption of this API was rather spotty to say the least. I certainly expect it to be better now, this is the least invasive option there is.</p>
<p>I have no idea about Tailscale, and from the look of it evaluating its security is a huge project. I might still decide to do it at some point, but you shouldn’t count on it.</p>

<p>Great deep analysis!
I've recently stumbled upon a <a href="https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/g/chromium-extensions/c/wZCMjRseCj0" rel="nofollow">thread discussing extension monetization</a> and some example extensions with Featured badges that uses it. But they download 56MB (!) JSON file filled with affiliate links - I couldn't believe it, there is more than 200,000 links inside from over 200 countries. Maybe worth investigating? I can't imagine resources needed to compile such a huge list.</p>

<p>As a naive nerd, I couldn't follow details of this blog. I was drawn in hoping to find straight advice and found a barrel-load of worms. In conclusion I understand that a basic PC user running Windows 10 Home, I should ditch everything Avast; go to Bitdefender and never trust anything that says "Trust me, I'm a secure program designed to protect the vulnerable," Have I got that right? Please consider setting up a kindergarten thread for absolute beginners.  Thanks for your work. Art</p>

<p>Hi Wladimir,</p>
<p>first of all, it's an absolute delight to read your blog and the level of detail you go into the topics you discuss. Someone linked me a single article of yours and since then I have been digging into so many of them!</p>
<p>Like Sunflowers, I have was also wondering if you're still somewhat interested in following up on Bitdefender's current state compared to your last article on them. They still have the option of fully scanning the webpages you visit and the option to scan "encrypted webpages". One thing I did not is that they no longer replace the TLS certificate of the browser, or at least the browser tells me it is the original certificate, not Bitdefender's. They also don't seem to require an extension to be scanning the webpage so I'm not sure how they intend to scan the webpage then.</p>
<p>But I'm also very interested to have your take on Tailscale's service. I'm an active user of it, but I'm not versed enough into security practices inside network code (which Tailscale's is open-source) to notice the potential attack surfaces other than common sense. Interested to hear your take on its control plane service and their extra services like Tailscale SSH on which they more or less replace the original SSH service with a proxy-like service and Tailscale serve/funnel.</p>
<p>Regardless what you do: keep up the great work of your blog, I'll definitely keep reading and sharing it to interested people!</p>

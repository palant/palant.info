<p>Thanks Wladimir, </p>
<p>I got Bitdefender totally confused with Microsoft Defender; I picked up Bit from your posts to other enquirers but failed to distinguish Bit from Micro or Windows Defenders, which was in my mind as perhaps being a better program of secure software. You seem very against Avast yet I've found another advisor very much in favour of the Czech provider. I've been using Avast for over ten years since recommended to me by a guy making a living out of managing software for companies. While no solution is perfect I have few complaints about Avast, except what you revealed about some underhand selling of data. But I understand FTC has now clamped down on that. 
I have decided that I'll reacquaint with Avast, "the Devil I know,"  because Bit D has deluged my Windows 10 Home with bewildering addons and 'Who knows What.' I simply hate being pushed and censored by anybody, but Avast is more like a long-time buddy I can 'rub along with' pretty much okay. Getting Bit off my system is a bit of a mystery tour but I'll get there. Then maybe I'll go to Microsoft Defender; maybe. Thanks again for your diligent work.  Art</p>

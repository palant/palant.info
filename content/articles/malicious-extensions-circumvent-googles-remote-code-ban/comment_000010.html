<p>I came across this blog post via Google while searching for "virtualstatistic[.]com" and it came up as the first result.</p>
<p>I have a browser instance with only two extensions, one for speeding up videos (which came back negative for any , the other for downloading vimeo videos - "Video Downloader for Vimeo â€“ Save Videos Easily" (mnngggofppeppickpphoggglkpnkgkjg)</p>
<p>While searching google for "why is discord forcing logging in multiple times on the same browser with different tabs?" I came across this forum topic (https:\forums.opera[.]com\topic/75187/forced-to-re-log-into-discord) and when I clicked on the page to scroll down it redirected to https:\boxshoper[.]com\redirect\aHR0cHM6Ly9tdHVzcmVkZS5kZS9oLzBIdTMwd25YMHJscD91cmw9aHR0cHMlM0ElMkYlMkZmb3J1bXMub3BlcmEuY29tJTJGdG9waWMlMkY3NTE4NyUyRmZvcmNlZC10by1yZS1sb2ctaW50by1kaXNjb3JkJTJGMyZzPWpqZHJ3YzhmZTdkNjE%3D</p>
<p>(forward slash replaced with backslashes)</p>
<p>The url failed to load (Potentially blocked by NordVPN DNS filtering)</p>
<p>I used ChatGPT to dig into the extension and it advised that non-Vimeo external domain present: check.virtualstatistic[.]com</p>
<p>Found occurrences in:</p>
<p>js/background_script.js</p>
<p>js/content_script.js</p>
<p>The domain was created on 4 August 2025-08-04 and the extension was updated 14 August 2025-08-14</p>
<p>I'm unsure if the url found in the extension was related to the redirected url on the opera forums but it is concerning that a non-Vimeo external domain is found in a featured extension with 20,000 users, with both domain creation date and extension update dates so close together.</p>

<p>Note that the domain mentioned in my post is a different one, despite the similarity. That configuration request is suspicious, and there are indications that this extension belongs to one of the malicious extension groups I reported before. But I don’t really see any malicious functionality in the current version. Most importantly: from all I can see, this extension only affects vimeo.com. This might (and likely will) change in future but right now this extension doesn’t seem to be the culprit you are looking for.</p>

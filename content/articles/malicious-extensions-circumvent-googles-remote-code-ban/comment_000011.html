<p>Reporting back about mnngggofppeppickpphoggglkpnkgkjg "Video Downloader for Vimeo" By: vvictorwhiite  .. I've just been notified by Brave the extension is malicious and has been disabled and removed from the Chrome Web Store.</p>
<p>It's disappointing that Google not only fails to thoroughly review extensions but also features them.. according to chrome-stats the extension had 30,000+ users.</p>

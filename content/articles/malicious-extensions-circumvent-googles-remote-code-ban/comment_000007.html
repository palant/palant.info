<p>Obviously, the issue is not a lack of time or resources within the Chrome Store moderation team. Take note that dozens of clusters, each containing dozens of extensions with fully documented proof of their malicious nature, continue to operate in the Store, carrying out their harmful activities. At the same time, extensions that are merely suspected of having the technical capability to violate Store policies are removed immediately.</p>
<p>It is clear that the Chrome Store moderation team has an insider (or insiders) colluding with the owners of these malicious extensions. They exploit the efforts of enthusiasts and investigators to create the illusion of active enforcement within the team. In reality, they block legitimate and well-intentioned extensions that fall under suspicion while allowing obvious malware to remain.</p>

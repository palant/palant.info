<p>MWB has been cleaning PhonixInvicta adware from my Chrome browser daily for a month. I tried clearing out some extensions (including one called Pie Adblock for Youtube, or something like that). We'll see if that fixes the daily cleanup by MWB. Interestingly, after removing that extension and restarting, Chrome finally does not show up with Extension Error for the first time in months.</p>

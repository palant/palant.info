<p>I am not aware of any ways for an extension to detect an open Developer Tools window</p>

<p>Could they use mechanisms similar to what sites like watchseries.bar are using? Besides the very direct "debugger" statement which you'd probably not use as an extension, there also seems to be code that slows things to a crawl with the dev console open. Could timings or other side channels be used to detect an open dev console?</p>

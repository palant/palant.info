<p>Good question.</p>
<p>Assuming that this extension is all about selling your browsing history and affiliate fraud (which is what it looks like), you should think about what your browsing history tells about you. See <a href="https://palant.info/2020/02/18/insights-from-avast/jumpshot-data-pitfalls-of-data-anonymization/" rel="nofollow">https://palant.info/2020/02/18/insights-from-avast/jumpshot-data-pitfalls-of-data-anonymization/</a> for example where I look at such data. If somebody were to connect this data to you, what would be the risks? Is there something in there that your government might find objectionable, that allows blackmailing you or makes phishing attacks on you easier? Then you should better prepare for such eventualities.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, thatâ€™s all based on the assumption that I figured out all of the malicious functionality, and I cannot promise you that. Worst-case scenario: you have to assume that your login credentials are compromised. So it might be a good idea to reset the passwords at least for critical accounts (the ones related to your identity like email and the ones related to money).</p>

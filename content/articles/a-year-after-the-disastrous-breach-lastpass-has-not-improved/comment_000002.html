<p>Thanks again for your fruitful insights into Lastpass. I was a customer and have moved to another password manager.</p>
<p>I am curious if their subscriber base has shrunk due to their ineptitude. After some googling, i couldn't uncover any concrete numbers.</p>
<p>It could also explain their non-movement on these critical items. If it was a minimal drop in revenue, then keep staying the course and do not change a thing.</p>

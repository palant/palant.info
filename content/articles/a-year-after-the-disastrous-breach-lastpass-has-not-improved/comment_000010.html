<p>What I don't understand (or completely overlooked in the news) is why nobody sued LastPass. I mean companies and people are sued for much less then this in the US. It can't be that nobody has actual damage because of all their passwords leaked, or did the hackers just hack LastPass and then deleted their looted data, not selling or using it anyway or anywhere?</p>

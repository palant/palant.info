<p>The last few weeks, multiple accounts of mine have been compromised.
I was a customer of Lastpass up until the leak last year.</p>
<p>Now I can't guarantee that someone decrypted the passwords or that my accounts being compromised is in any way connected.</p>
<p>But I am lazy and didn't change all my passwords.</p>
<p>I was wondering if anybody else got compromised in the last weeks.</p>

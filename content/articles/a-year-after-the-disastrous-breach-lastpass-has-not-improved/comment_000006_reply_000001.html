<p>I guess you meant to write “the vault <em>not</em> being an opaque blob”?</p>
<p>Yes, compromised server associating an existing password with a different website is a risk, one that I notified LastPass about in January 2018. My report was about EquivalentDomains not being encrypted, but attackers could really manipulate the URL field just as well. LastPass paid a bug bounty for the report and resolved it in August 2018 without actually fixing the issue. The replies on similar submissions went into the direction that a compromised server is not considered an issue because the server is well-protected.</p>

<p>I think that the vault being an opaque blob brings one more risk (albeit probably smaller): unless pieces of data are encrypted with additional data that indicates what they are, an attacker who has compromised the vault storage can permute them around and e.g. cause a password to be used on a different site than it's actually for (e.g. on an attacker-controlled one).</p>

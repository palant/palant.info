<p>I work for a company that gives a LastPass account to every employee. Fortunately I and many of my colleagues didn't use it. But the company didn't say a word about the LastPass breach -- no 'update your password' or 'change vault passwords,' nada. And the LastPass wasn't integrated into SSO or anything. I couldn't believe it. I imagine there are a lot of corporations similar to mine with plenty of sitting duck users.</p>

<p>Wow just wanted to say thanks for a clear breakdown on what's going on with LastPass. I was linked this article and have since gone through some of your other excellent posts. </p>
<p>LastPass was the first password manager I heard about many years ago. When the idea of a password manager came up I initially looked at LP but ended up going with a different manager due to the unpleasing UI. I'm glad I did!</p>

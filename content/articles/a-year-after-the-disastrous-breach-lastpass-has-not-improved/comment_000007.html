<p>LastPass is dead after they sold the company. Don't know why we keep hoping they will change anything. It's pretty obvious they don't care and most of the original people who have brains have left. This is just a company now to earn money before the next breach. Once that happens they will pay a fine. The company I worked for offered LastPass but it took the 2 breach to move on. Luckily I had moved on way past the first breach.</p>

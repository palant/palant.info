<p>Great article!</p>
<p>Now I understand why all my colleagues in South Korea blindly install every software, that they are being asked to install by some random external "authority". Crazy.</p>
<p>But what's the conclusion for banking users in South Korea in early 2024? Just go with it, install the unsafe spyware plug-ins and hope for the best? Or are there alternatives (ideally English speaking banks) that don't require me to potentially open up my PC to god knows whom?</p>

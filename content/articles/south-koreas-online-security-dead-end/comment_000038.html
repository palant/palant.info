<p>My sincerest gratitude for your enlightening blog on the online security practices of Korean banks.I have previously encountered security requests from our finance department to install software mandated by Korean banks due to our client conducting business in Korea. Upon review, we noticed concerning requests from this software, such as demanding access to lsass.exe and other sensitive processes integral to credential management on the operating system. Our EDR (Anti-malware), by default, denied these requests, highlighting them to our security team.</p>
<p>Your blog played a crucial role in highlighting the inherent risks and helped me convincingly explain to our CFO the repercussions of installing such software on our corporate laptops. This insight led me to propose an alternative: creating virtual apps in our VDI environment, allowing users to operate safely in the contanerised environment.</p>
<p>I am eager to share it with a broader audience via my YouTube channel https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCxL-lRgZgO5WZbp0TuCaAA, focusing on cybersecurity. I am creating a visual presentation to highlight the concerns surrounding the mandatory installation of bank software. I hope to gain your permission to use your content ethically, ensuring proper attribution and maintaining the essence of your original message.</p>

<p>Thanks. So mobile banking is safe and doesn't come with these side effects?</p>
<p>Another interesting example of Korean IT security: I just moved to Korea as an EXPAT and the company who is supposed to help me settle in, wanted me to install their own app on my iPhone to communicate with me. They claim "it's better &amp; more efficient than using e-mail". On the iPhone their app requires me to first install (and trust...) a proprietary  device management profile coming from them under "VPN &amp; Device Management". The profile already says "not trusted"... </p>
<p>This is crazy!!</p>

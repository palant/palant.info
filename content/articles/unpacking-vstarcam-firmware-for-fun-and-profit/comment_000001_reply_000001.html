<p>Yes, these cameras tend to be very different technologically as I’ve noted under <a href="https://palant.info/2026/01/07/backdoors-in-vstarcam-cameras/#establishing-a-timeline" rel="nofollow">https://palant.info/2026/01/07/backdoors-in-vstarcam-cameras/#establishing-a-timeline</a>. The firmware update for the versions you mention does not seem to contain the /system directory at all – there is the tag partition, kernel and rootfs. Not that /system was relevant for me – the main application is located under /usr/bin here, and /system only seems to contain the web UI which is generally updated separately. And: yes, there are many application versions that don’t use the system.ini file (I could be wrong but on the first glance this one seems to be specific to ARM hardware).</p>

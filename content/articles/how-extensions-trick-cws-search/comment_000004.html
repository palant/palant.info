<p>Thank you for doing this excellent research. I've been finding some of these extensions through suspicious/malicious domains they are using and cross checking with your lists. Most of the extensions I've found are on your lists already. The domains I've seen all have a pattern and the requests are usually to /api or /multi. Domains registered on June 4, 2024 or July 12, 2024. </p>

<p>Geez, a pretty sad state of things if you ask me
Great article!</p>
<p>I'd say that at this point, the CWS team doesn't really have a reason to deal with this - CWS is already entrenched in terms of extension marketplaces (amongst browsers) and has 100s of millions of users. 
Not only that - developers are in abundance, and most won't even know about this (count me as an example, I only found out by links to that chromium groups thread from 2023).</p>
<p>Those that do, and those that <em>do</em> something about it, will mostly care about how it affects their products, which makes sense. So in those cases (perhaps like Norton) Google might do something [for them].</p>
<p>Finally, in the end the extensions still engage users - which is CWS's bottom line, and unfortunately, users <em>do</em> have them installed. So if Chrome removes the extensions, that might upset affected users, and we're talking 10s of millions. </p>
<p>Though still, I can only comment as an observer; it'd be a little foolish to think the team/Google doesn't have the resources to address this.</p>
<p>Regardless, good stuff!</p>
<p>Also in a cruel twist of fate, this article inevitably helps these extensions with search ranking, right?
(As if they'd need further help anyway!)</p>

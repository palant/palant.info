<p>What's funny about keepa is the fact that it was privately co-developed by Palantir Technologies and NSO Group. This plugin makes no attempt to anonymize data. In fact, this plugin effectively works as a man in the middle-- why go to the trouble of breaking SSL-encrypted data when you can export it to a .csv file in plaintext? The funny thing is that none of us are the targets of their data mining. Palantir and NSO are after VIP data. They don't just leave our data sitting idly in a data farm though. It is neatly, neatly packaged and sold to data brokers. It's impossible to say what happens next. If you are using keepa without a custom script, you may as well send all of your most sensitive information directly to the sketchiest online marketing outfit you can find. How do I know? I helped develop keepa. I quit when I found out what its genuine use case was.</p>

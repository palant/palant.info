<p>I know this is old, but Honey recently got into allegations of affiliate fraud</p>
<p>They might have patched that out by now, even maybe silently through the server sending code to the client thing you have shown here</p>
<p>That server sending code thing might also be removed because MV3, but if it isn't that's also in violation of Chrome Web Store policies I believe</p>
